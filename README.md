# Large Schematics
this mod will allow you to save bigger schematics

## How to use
1. go to settings -> controls and unbind the schematic menu key, `T`
2. enter a world, hold t and take a bigger schematic than normal
3. copy the base64 schematic code from the text box, and close it by clicking any of the buttons

### notes
- the saved schematic will kind of be broken, but pasting it/sharing it will work normally
- the schematic preview will have broken shadows
- you can save a bigger area than the rectangle outline renders (2147483647 x 2147483647)
- couldnt make it save the schematic in the schematics menu or as a msch file, so it shows a popup
